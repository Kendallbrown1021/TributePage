          Granddaughter and niece Kenisha Desiree, The manner in which you lived
          is described well in Longfellow’s poem, “A PSALM OF LIFE”. In every
          breath you took, you tried to instill in everyone you met your
          testimony with God, in life and workforce “it’s not about me, it’s
          teamwork.” Longfellos’s poem reveals “ Life that send a Challenge to
          its end and when it comes, say welcome friend.” Verses 5 and 9 in this
          poem puts into words that you were trying to get co-workers,
          employee’s, family, and friends to understand, “don’t be dumb like
          driven cattle,” instead “be a hero, be up doing and achieving,
          persuing, learn to labor, and wait.” We see some of your wisdom was
          passed on to your nephews, nieces, younger cousins, and co-workers.
          Your work was not in vain. We miss you, your million-dollar smile that
          lights a room, that saddens us tremendously, but we are happy that you
          are no longer suffering. You are now in the heavinly fathers’ care.
          Thank you for sharing and loving us. Grandma Mae, zia LaVerne, and the
          entire clan.
